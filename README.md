# Rainbow Six Siege Player Stats Website

This is a work in progress website to get Rainbow Six player statistics. It uses Ubisoft's official API.

Before you want to use it you need to make a file named api_ticket in the getStats folder.

While making this I used the existing Rainbow-Six-Siege-Player-Stats-API project from Seems2Legit, https://github.com/Seems2Legit/Rainbow-Six-Siege-Player-Stats-API.
